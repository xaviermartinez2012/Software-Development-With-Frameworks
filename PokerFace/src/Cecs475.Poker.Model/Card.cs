		// Since mSuit is private, we need a way for other classes to access that value. In Java we would do this with a
		// "get" accessor method. You could do that in C# too, but the preference in .NET languages is to use a property.
		public CardSuit Suit {
			// The name of this property is Suit, and its type is CardSuit. Note that this is not a method because there 
			// are no parentheses.
			// Inside a property block we can have two other blocks: a get block and a set block.
			get {
				// A get block is like an accessor, and is called when someone wants to retrieve a value from the property.
				// In this case, we just return our private variable.
				return mSuit;
			}
			// If we want others to be able to mutate the property, we can provide a set block as well. It doesn't really
			// make sense for Suit to need to be mutated after construction, but we can still demo the idea.
			set {
				// Someone wants to change the card's suit to a new value. Inside of a set block, we have a special variable
				// named "value", representing the new value to set the property to.
				// value can be thought of as the parameter to a Java mutator method.
				mSuit = value;
			}
		}

		// Without the verbose comments, we get something like this:
		public CardKind Kind {
			get { return mKind; }
			set { mKind = value; }
		}
		// which is a nicer way of defining an accessor/mutator pair than Java's slightly longer getX/setX standard.


		// As in Java, the Object class defines a method ToString for creating a string representation of an object.
		// The override keyword is mandatory and indicates we are changing the behavior of a method defined in a base
		// class.
